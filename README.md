# Resources for the eGenix Talk "Programming hardware displays the easy way - using MicroPython and LVGL"

## Abstract

The world of embedded hardware devices is often considered difficult and having a steep learning curve. MicroPython has changed this for the better and now you no longer have to drop to C to implement your ideas on microcontrollers and dedicated hardware.

In this talk, we will explore the world of visualizing data using a nifty device based on the ESP32 microcontroller and a TFT display - better known under the name Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) - with the aim of creating a hardware conference talk timer.

The implementation is done in MicroPython and uses the high  quality open source embedded graphics library LVGL, the basis of many commercial devices with displays and smart watches, for beautiful graphics.

I’ll show the tooling needed to get started, useful resources, demo the application and discuss some of the pitfalls found along the way.
